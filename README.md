# UFO-s

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to explore JavaScrip and, coupled with HTML and CSS, create a dynamic HTML page that responds to input to make changes in the page. In this case, we create a page that displays details about UFO sitings over a set of locations and this data, that is being displayed in a table, can be changed and filtered by different properties.  

## Reuslts
The table of the webpage will change it's contents once a filtered is entered in any one of the input boxes. The user can enter a date in the form DD/MM/YYY, and the UFO sightings that relate to this date will be the only data displayed on the table. The user can also filter the displayed data by City, State, Country, and Shape

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that is does not have a filter for the duration of the sighting for those who may want to only look at data that has been sighted for a specific time or time period. I would suggest a duration filter as well as a filter to find certain words in the comments for those who may want to view sighting data that have a common description in the comments.
